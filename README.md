# Pega Custom DX Component for a Calendar Widget

This Pega custom DX component brings Calendar functionality to Cosmos React applications. It is configurable through parameters similar to the OOTB `pxCalendar` section rule.
You can source the Calendar using a data page. If you pass a class name for your data object, you can create a new data record using the Create button, calendar will be automatically refreshed.

This project is kind of an extension of an implementation published by Pega (https://support.pega.com/discussion/how-implement-calendar-widget-constellation-ui-dx-component?). </br>
Also, this implementation is in Javascript, however Pega recommends Typescript, you can check out this official repo for other custom DX components (https://github.com/pegasystems/constellation-ui-gallery/tree/master). </br>
Purpose of this implementation is to enable the usage of data object records for calendar events data source.
